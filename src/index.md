## What a lame title for a first post…

It’s not the first time I post a blog post but my last post must be 13 years old… I used to blog about various subjects, my job as an UX/UI designer, my discovers, my side projects… It was a bit of a passion at one moment until I had better things to do. 

## In english ? Why not, but french too

When I look around the web I find a lot of good posts written in a language I can’t read, I can use Google translate… One day it’ll be usable.

## How will I post, no Wordpress, no database

This post could become a tutorial about how to create your blog. What I needed for this

- Technologies I know, that I use __almost__ everyday;
- Simple and fun to use;
- Open sourced.

What I chose…

- Markdown for the content, it’s simple and used almost everywhere. No databaseor my database will be an organised folder;
- Metalsmith as a __blog engine__ it’s not the most famous tool or the lastest one but I ever used this static site generator in the past and it does what I needed;
- Github hosts the code used in this blog but also hosts the static content generated, maybe elsewhere the day Microsoft becomes too present…
- CSS ftw, no SASS, SCSS, Stylus… Simple CSS file optimised by PostCSS; 

This is placholder link to a tutorial.
